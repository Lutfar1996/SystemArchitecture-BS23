Explanation:

Global CDN: Utilize a content delivery network (CDN) to cache static content and serve it from edge locations closer to users worldwide, reducing latency and improving performance.

Load Balancer: Implement a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of web servers. This ensures high availability and scalability. AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) or Application Load Balancer (ALB) can be used.

Auto Scaling Group: Set up an auto-scaling group for the web servers. This automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on traffic demand. It ensures that there are enough instances to handle peak loads and scales down during low traffic periods, optimizing costs.

Web Servers (EC2): Host the application logic on EC2 instances. These instances handle user requests, different types of read and write APIs, and background jobs. EC2 instances can be launched from pre-configured Amazon Machine Images (AMIs).

Database: Depending on your specific requirements and workload characteristics, choose between Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) for relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc., or Amazon DynamoDB for NoSQL database needs. RDS provides scalability, high availability, and automated backups, while DynamoDB offers seamless scalability and high performance.

Object Store: Store static assets, user uploads, and other media files in Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service). For long-term archival, consider using Amazon Glacier for cost-effective storage.

This architecture provides scalability, high availability, and performance optimization while keeping costs in check by utilizing auto-scaling and cloud-native services.
